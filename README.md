# Elixium Improvement Proposals
The exips repository is here to document Elixium Network design decisions as well as to serve as a location for ongoing research regarding specific Elixium features. Each EXIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature. A template for constructing EXIPs can be found [here](https://github.com/ElixiumNetwork/exips/blob/master/EXIP-0000.md)
